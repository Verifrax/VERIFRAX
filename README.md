# VERIFRAX v1 — Finality Infrastructure

VERIFRAX is not a product.
VERIFRAX is not a service.
VERIFRAX is not a platform.

VERIFRAX defines how truth is finalized after dispute, failure, or uncertainty.

Once a VERIFRAX verdict exists:
– Narratives cannot override evidence
– Authority cannot reinterpret outcomes
– History cannot be revised

Maintainers have no authority over verdict meaning or dispute resolution.
