# Phase 7 End State (Hard)

## VERIFRAX

VERIFRAX:
- Produces computation
- Packages computation
- Verifies computation

## NOTHING ELSE

VERIFRAX does not:
- Provide legal conclusions
- Determine truth
- Certify compliance
- Assign liability
- Assert chain of custody
- Provide advisory services

## Scope

VERIFRAX executes deterministic computation only. All other interpretations are outside system scope.

## Authority

Computation is authoritative. Interpretation is external.

## Finality

Certificates are final. Packages are final. No mutation. No re-issuance. No revocation.
