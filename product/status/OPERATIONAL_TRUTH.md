# VERIFRAX Operational Truth

This document defines authoritative operational facts.

---

## System State

VERIFRAX operates as a deterministic verification system.

No mutable user state exists.
No accounts exist.
No sessions exist.

---

## Availability

Verification execution is availability-dependent.
Historical verification artifacts remain valid regardless of system state.

---

## Failure Modes

If VERIFRAX is unavailable:
- No execution occurs
- No finality is issued
- No partial states are created

Previously issued artifacts remain verifiable.

---

## Transparency

Operational status reflects factual system behavior only.
No marketing, estimates, or forward-looking statements are provided.
