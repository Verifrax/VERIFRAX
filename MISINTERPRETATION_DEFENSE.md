# Misinterpretation Defense

## Invalid Interpretations

The following interpretations are **invalid** and outside system scope:

### Legal Proof ❌

VERIFRAX certificates are not legal proof. VERIFRAX executes deterministic computation only.

### Truth Determination ❌

VERIFRAX does not determine truth. VERIFRAX verifies computation against declared rules.

### Compliance Certification ❌

VERIFRAX does not certify compliance. VERIFRAX executes verification algorithm only.

### Liability Assignment ❌

VERIFRAX does not assign liability. VERIFRAX produces computation results only.

## Statement

**Any such interpretation is outside system scope.**

## System Scope

VERIFRAX:
- Executes deterministic computation
- Produces certificates
- Verifies computation

VERIFRAX does not:

- Determine truth
