# Phase 9 End State (Absolute Hard Stop)

## VERIFRAX

VERIFRAX:
- Can disappear
- Leaves behind verifiable facts

## NOTHING Depends On

NOTHING depends on:
- Servers
- People
- Company
- Domain
- Payment processor

## Independence

Verification artifacts are:
- Self-contained
- Independently verifiable
- Infrastructure-independent
- Company-independent
- Domain-independent
- Payment-independent

## Final State

VERIFRAX may cease to exist.

Verification artifacts do not.

## Terminal Phase

This is the terminal phase.

VERIFRAX is ready for disappearance.
