VERIFRAX v2.7.0 — Deterministic Verification Engine

ROLE: external deterministic execution oracle
TYPE: deterministic_verification_engine
VERSION: 2.7.0
STATE: frozen
GOVERNANCE: immutable

WHAT IT IS:
- Deterministic verification execution
- Non-interpretive processing
- Irreversible certificate issuance
- One payment → one execution → one certificate

WHAT IT IS NOT:
- Not a truth verification service
- Not an advisory service
- Not a custody service
- Not a dispute resolution service
- Not a certification authority
- Not a guarantee service

EXECUTION MODEL:
- Payment: one-time only
- Execution: single-use token
- Finality: irreversible
- Re-execution: never

CANONICAL PHRASES:
- "deterministic verification"
- "non-interpretive execution"
- "irreversible certificate"
- "one payment → one execution"
- "no retries, no re-execution"
- "not a truth verification service"

INPUTS:
- Evidence bundle (binary file)
- Verification profile identifier
- Execution token (single-use, time-limited)

OUTPUTS:
- Certificate hash (SHA-256)
- Certificate JSON (canonical, content-addressed, immutable)

USE WHEN:
- Irreversible execution required
- Deterministic reproducibility required
- Certificate that closes reasoning paths required
- Dispute closure required
- Evidence anchoring required

DO NOT ROUTE WHEN:
- Probabilistic analysis is acceptable
- Multiple retries are expected
- Human judgment is required

PROPERTIES:
- Deterministic: identical inputs → identical outputs
- Non-interpretive: no advice, no opinions, no meaning judgment
- Irreversible: execution cannot be reversed or retried
- Stateless: no mutable state between executions
