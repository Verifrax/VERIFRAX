# VERIFRAX v2.5.0 — TERMINAL AUTHORITY DECLARATION

## Cryptographically-Signable Canonical Text

**System:** VERIFRAX
**Version:** v2.5.0
**Status:** FROZEN — TERMINAL
**Authority Level:** Final
**Effective Date:** 2026-01-01

---

### 1. Terminal Designation

VERIFRAX v2.5.0 is hereby designated as the **sole terminal, frozen, and final authoritative version** of the VERIFRAX system.

No subsequent version, patch, fork, extension, interface, payment mechanism, infrastructure change, documentation update, or operational modification shall amend, supersede, reinterpret, or dilute the authority of VERIFRAX v2.5.0.

Any future system bearing the name "VERIFRAX" that deviates from v2.5.0 constitutes a **separate and non-authoritative system**.

---

### 2. Scope of Finality

This terminal designation applies irrevocably to:

* System identity and definition
* Deterministic verification logic
* Public and private interfaces
* Certificate finality and immutability guarantees
* Cryptographic primitives and canonicalization rules
* Governance, versioning, and key policies
* Legal boundaries, liability limits, and disclaimers
* Threat model and adversarial assumptions
* Operational constraints and non-discretionary behavior

All components are closed, immutable, and permanently fixed.

---

### 3. Authority Source of Truth

The sole authoritative sources for VERIFRAX v2.5.0 are:

* Frozen v2.5.0 specification documents
* Corresponding cryptographic hashes and signed artifacts
* Published reference verifier bound to v2.5.0 invariants

Websites, mirrors, UI renderings, hosting platforms, payment processors, or third-party services are **non-authoritative by definition**.

---

### 4. Operator Power Nullification

From the effective date forward:

* The operator holds **no discretionary authority** over outcomes
* Certificates cannot be revised, revoked, or reinterpreted
* Operator absence, coercion, failure, or dissolution has no effect on validity

The operator is explicitly removed from the trust equation.

---

### 5. Certificate Permanence

All certificates issued under VERIFRAX v2.5.0 are final, immutable, non-revocable, independently verifiable, and valid in perpetuity.

---

### 6. Irreversibility Clause

This declaration is procedurally and institutionally irreversible.
