# VERIFRAX v2.5.0 — Institution-Grade Delivery

This release adds structure and clarity to VERIFRAX verification, without adding power or custody.

## Core Invariant

> v2.5.0 adds *structure and clarity*, not *power or custody*.  
> All authority remains documentary + cryptographic.

## Included

- Verification Classification (informational only)
- Failure Class Taxonomy (taxonomic only)
- Trust Context Bundles (TCB) support (optional, external, revocable)
- Multi-Profile Attestation (parallel, non-collapsing)
- Reference verifier extensions (offline-only)
- Comprehensive test matrix
- Adversarial threat model
- Platform alignment documentation

## Guarantees

- Deterministic execution
- Reproducible verification
- Stateless operation
- Offline verification (reference verifier)
- v2.4.0 backward compatibility
- Zero semantic authority leakage

## Status

This release is considered stable.
All future changes require explicit version increments.

## Authority

This release is FROZEN and IMMUTABLE.
All authoritative content is in `freeze/v2.5.0/`.

## Independence

If **GitHub is deleted**, **Cloudflare is shut down**, **AWS is wiped**, **Stripe is disabled**:

> **v2.5.0 still verifies truth.**

That is institutional correctness.
