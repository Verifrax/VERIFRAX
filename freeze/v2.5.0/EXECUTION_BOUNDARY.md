VERIFRAX v2.5.0 EXECUTION BOUNDARY

The following are frozen and irreversible:
- Public HTTP surfaces
- Response semantics
- Determinism guarantees
- Payment disabled state
- Certificate finality

Any future changes occur strictly above this boundary
via orchestration, profiles, or external tooling.

Core execution logic remains immutable.
