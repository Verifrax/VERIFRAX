# VERIFRAX — SUPER-PRO ADVANCED · SUPER-IDEAL AUTHORITY STATE

**System:** VERIFRAX  
**Authority Level:** FINAL · FROZEN · SEALED  
**Operational Mode:** Deterministic · Non-Interpretive · Irreversible

This document states the **ideal, complete, and closed authority posture** of VERIFRAX as an institutional-grade verification primitive.

---

## I. SYSTEM IDENTITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

VERIFRAX is a **deterministic verification execution system**.

* One payment → one execution → one certificate
* Identical inputs → identical outputs (byte-for-byte)
* No randomness, no interpretation, no discretion
* No mutable state, no retries, no revisions

The system executes computation. It does not judge meaning.

---

## II. EXECUTION FINALITY (ABSOLUTE)

* Execution is **irreversible**
* Tokens are **single-use and burned**
* Certificate issuance **closes the transaction permanently**
* No revocation, no modification, no appeal
* Outcome dissatisfaction and third-party rejection are irrelevant

Finality is technical, not procedural.

---

## III. CERTIFICATE ONTOLOGY

Certificates are **facts**, not opinions.

Each certificate is:

* Canonical JSON
* Content-addressed by its own SHA-256 hash
* Immutable and independently verifiable
* Valid regardless of operator, infrastructure, or time

Certificates do not expire. Infrastructure may.

---

## IV. OPERATOR FIREWALL (TOTAL)

The operator:

* Cannot alter executions
* Cannot revoke or modify certificates
* Cannot recover tokens
* Cannot bypass payment
* Cannot interpret or explain outcomes

Silence is enforced by design.
Liability is structurally contained.

---

## V. STORAGE & CUSTODY BOUNDARY

* Evidence retention exists **only** as a by-product of execution finality and reproducibility
* No custodial, access, or retrieval service is implied
* No general-purpose storage function exists

VERIFRAX is not a repository. It is an execution trace.

---

## VI. GOVERNANCE & VERSION ISOLATION

* Each version is a **separate system**
* v2.7.0 is **frozen permanently**
* No changes affecting execution semantics, verification logic, or certificate generation
* Infrastructure mitigations may occur only if behavior remains unchanged

Future versions do not modify the past.

---

## VII. NON-RELIANCE RULE

No party may rely on a VERIFRAX certificate as a substitute for:

* Independent verification
* Legal judgment
* Regulatory determination

Reliance is external. VERIFRAX is neutral.

---

## VIII. INSTITUTIONAL POSTURE

VERIFRAX is:

* Court-safe
* Auditor-compatible
* Infrastructure-independent
* Operator-independent
* Jurisdiction-agnostic

It is a **verification primitive**, not a service narrative.

---

## IX. AUTHORITY REFERENCES

* **VERIFRAX v2.6.0 — Institutional Blueprint** 
* **VERIFRAX v2.7.0 — Complete Authority Dossier** 

These artifacts define the closed authority perimeter.

---

## X. END STATE

VERIFRAX exists in a **sealed condition**.

* Deterministic
* Final
* Non-interpretive
* Institution-ready

No further explanation is required.
No further action is permitted.

**AUTHORITY STATE: CLOSED**
