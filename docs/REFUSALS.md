# What VERIFRAX Refuses

**Negative Space - Explicit Absences**

## Refused: Subjective Inputs

VERIFRAX does not accept:
- Human judgment calls
- Qualitative assessments
- Opinion-based evidence
- Narrative interpretations

**Why**: Finality requires determinism. Subjectivity breaks finality.

## Refused: Voting

VERIFRAX does not implement:
- Majority voting
- Consensus mechanisms
- Stake-weighted decisions
- Democratic processes

**Why**: Voting creates mutable outcomes. Finality is immutable.

## Refused: Moderation

VERIFRAX does not provide:
- Content moderation
- Evidence filtering
- Claim approval workflows
- Editorial oversight

**Why**: Moderation is a policy surface. Finality has no policy surface.

## Refused: Overrides

VERIFRAX does not allow:
- Administrative overrides
- Emergency bypasses
- Exception handling
- Manual corrections

**Why**: Overrides break unappealable surface. Finality is unappealable.

## Refused: External State

VERIFRAX does not depend on:
- Network connectivity
- External APIs
- Real-time data
- Live databases

**Why**: External state is mutable. Finality requires immutability.

## Refused: Feature Requests

VERIFRAX does not accept:
- New feature requests
- UX improvements
- Convenience features
- Market-driven changes

**Why**: Features dilute finality. Only hardening allowed.

**These refusals are permanent. They define what VERIFRAX is not.**
