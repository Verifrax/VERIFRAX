# Why Determinism Matters More Than Trust

Trust-based systems require participants to believe in the integrity of authorities, validators, or intermediaries. Deterministic systems require no such trust because the outcome is mathematically verifiable.

In a deterministic verification system:

- Given the same evidence bundle
- And the same verification profile
- The output is always identical

This property eliminates the need to trust any party. Any observer can independently verify the result by re-running the same evaluation process.

Trust-based systems introduce several failure modes:

1. Authority corruption
2. Consensus manipulation
3. State mutation
4. Interpretation drift

Deterministic systems avoid these by removing human judgment, mutable state, and external dependencies from the evaluation process.

The cost of determinism is rigidity: the system cannot adapt, interpret, or make exceptions. This is not a bug but a feature. Rigidity ensures that the same evidence always produces the same verdict, regardless of context, narrative, or pressure.
