# Why Verification Is Not Prediction

Verification evaluates evidence against declared standards. Prediction attempts to forecast future outcomes based on patterns, models, or heuristics.

These are fundamentally different operations:

**Verification:**
- Input: Evidence bundle + verification profile
- Process: Deterministic evaluation
- Output: Verdict (verified | not_verified)

**Prediction:**
- Input: Historical data + model
- Process: Statistical inference
- Output: Probability distribution

Verification is backward-looking: it asks "Does this evidence satisfy the standard?" Prediction is forward-looking: it asks "What will happen next?"

Verification systems do not:
- Predict outcomes
- Judge intent
- Provide opinions
- Modify evidence

They only determine whether submitted evidence meets declared criteria. This limitation is intentional. By restricting scope to verification, the system avoids the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in prediction.

A verification verdict is final because it is deterministic. A prediction is provisional because it depends on assumptions that may change.
