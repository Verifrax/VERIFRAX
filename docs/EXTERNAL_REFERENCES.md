# External References - Non-Promotional Seeding

**Quietly ensure dependency formation.**

## Citation Patterns

### Bug Reports

Bug reports should cite verdict IDs:

```
Issue: Media playback failure
Verdict ID: VFXV1:sha256:abc123...:sha256:def456...
Bundle: https://verifrax.org/index/bundles/abc123...
```

### Incident Reports

Incident reports should link bundles:

```
Incident: Data breach
Evidence Bundle: https://verifrax.org/index/bundles/xyz789...
Verdict: CONTRADICTED
Reason: Conflicting attestations detected
```

### Audits

Audits should reference axiom hashes:

```
Audit Report: Security Assessment
Axiom Hash: sha256:finality-axiom-v1-hash
Contract Hash: sha256:verdict-contract-v1-hash
Verdict ID: VFXV1:sha256:...:sha256:...
```

## Integration Points

### Incident Response Teams

- Reference verdict IDs in incident reports
- Link to evidence bundles
- Cite axiom hashes for reproducibility

### Compliance Teams

- Include verdict IDs in compliance reports
- Reference bundles in audit trails
- Document axiom hashes for legal proceedings

### Insurance Companies

- Use verdict IDs in claim assessments
- Link to evidence bundles
- Reference axiom hashes for policy verification

## Non-Promotional Approach

- Do not market VERIFRAX
- Do not advertise features
- Do not solicit adoption
- Let dependency form naturally through citation

## Rationale

Dependency forms through usage, not promotion.  
Citations create dependency.  
Dependency creates finality.
