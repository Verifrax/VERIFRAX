# Authority Version Coherence Note (Non-Authoritative)

This document clarifies published version references without modifying the frozen authoritative surface.

## Frozen authoritative surface
- freeze/v2.6.0/**
- verifrax-engine/execute_v2_6_0.js
- verifrax-reference-verifier/src/verify_v2_6_0.js

## Runtime surface
Runtime may advance independently, but authority remains pinned to the frozen surface above unless and until a formal authority-upgrade procedure is executed and sealed.

## Scope
This note is non-authoritative. It does not alter authority, execution, or verification behavior.
