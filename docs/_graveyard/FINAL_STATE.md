## VERIFRAX v1 is Complete When

1. **Truth exists without you**
   - Verdicts are self-contained
   - Bundles are self-contained
   - No infrastructure required

   - Narrative cannot change evidence

3. **Verdicts cite themselves**
   - Verdict IDs are self-referential
   - Bundle hashes are self-contained
   - No external lookup required

4. **No human can intervene**
   - No authority over semantics
   - No authority over truth
   - No authority over disputes

5. **No upgrade can overwrite**
   - v1 is immutable
   - New versions are separate
   - No migration path
